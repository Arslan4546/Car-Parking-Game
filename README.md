# Unity Car Parking Game

Welcome to the **Car Parking Game**, a project developed in Unity using C#. This game challenges players to navigate a vehicle through complex parking scenarios, testing their driving skills, precision, and patience. The project combines realistic vehicle physics, user-friendly controls, and engaging gameplay mechanics to deliver an immersive gaming experience.

## Features

- **Realistic Vehicle Physics**  
  The game uses Unity's Rigidbody physics to simulate authentic vehicle movement, including acceleration, braking, and steering dynamics.

- **Challenging Levels**  
  Multiple levels with varying difficulty, including narrow pathways, obstacles, and tight parking spaces.

- **User-Friendly Controls**  
  Intuitive keyboard or touch-based controls that allow players to easily maneuver their vehicle.
